# Position Project
<strong>Camera projection using the render of "World Position" and camera.</strong>

The most important advantage of this one is that it's a very light tool (you don't need to import in nuke a heavy mesh).
So it's fast and easy to use, but still has to have the position pass and the 3D camera ðŸ˜‰
